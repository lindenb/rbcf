Description: C Bindings to htslib (https://github.com/samtools/htslib)  for reading Bcf/Vcf files.
     The package contains a set of functions to open/close/scan/query a VCF/BCF file, as well a
     some functions to extract data from variants and genotypes.
     The package is working although it might evolve in the future ( nature of the returned object, names of the functions, etc...).
     I also need to improve the tests and the documentation.
